-- Introduction

Pocket Physics is a physical construction kit for your pocket.
You draw objects with the stylus and make them physical by
pressing the play button. Like this, you can design contraptions
and crazy machines on the go.


-- Requirements

Pocket Physics is homebrew software for the Nintendo DS. To run
it, you need a DS and an adapter card for booting homebrew.


-- Usage

The usage should be quite intuitive: Just draw on the screen!
The buttons on the upper right switch between solid and dynamic
objects. Press play to start the simulation, and press stop
to reset it. Use the box and circle tools on the lower left
to draw perfect boxes and circles. You can delete things with
the "X" tool next to the play button. If you want to start over,
tap the destructor button next to the delete button.

Tips:
 - You can even draw and delete things while the simulation is
   running.
 - If you have a DS Motion card, you can use it to control
   gravity. Just plug it in and start Pocket Physics. If you
   launch homebrew from Slot-1, swap your card for the DS Motion
   and press L+R.
