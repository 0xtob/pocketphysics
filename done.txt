since 0.1
---------
- pins! (pin to background or pin two objects together)
- standby
- numerical fixes in box2d
- moved from dynamic to static timestep => subjectively slower, but 100% reproducable

since 0.2
---------
- updated to box2d 2.0 (svn r20)
- if simulation is behind time, 2 steps are performed at once => subjectively faster
